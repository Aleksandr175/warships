# Trading

### Trade process

We send fleet with trade task. We can trade with any city, even with pirates.

After fleet arrives in the city it should wait for 10 minutes. After that fleet gets gold and returns back to the original city.

Fleet with that task can repeat its task if we set so while sending that fleet.

### Getting gold

Fleet gets by formula.

$gold = $availableCapacity / 10. 

### Future Updates

- trade fleet can be attacked in city where it is trading at that moment
- trading fleet can be attacked on their way to some city by pirates or player
- fix getting gold
- add tests for trading
